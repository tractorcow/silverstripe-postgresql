PostgreSQLDatabase:
# Determines whether to check a database exists on the host by
# querying the 'postgres' database and running createDatabase.
#
# Some locked down systems prevent access to the 'postgres' table in
# which case you need to set this to false.
#
# If allow_query_master_postgres is false, and model_schema_as_database is also false, 
# then attempts to create or check databases beyond the initial connection will
# result in a runtime error.
  allow_query_master_postgres: true
# For instances where multiple databases are used beyond the initial connection
# you may set this option to true to force database switches to switch schemas
# instead of using databases. This may be useful if the database user does not
# have cross-database permissions, and in cases where multiple databases are used
# (such as in running test cases).
# 
# If this is true then the database will only be set during the initial connection,
# and attempts to change to this database will use the 'public' schema instead
#
# If this is false then errors may be generated during some cross database operations.
  model_schema_as_database: true
# Override the language that tsearch uses.  By default it is 'english, but
# could be any of the supported languages that can be found in the
# pg_catalog.pg_ts_config table.
  search_language: 'english'
# These two values describe how T-search will work.
# You can use either GiST or GIN, and '@@' (gist) or '@@@' (gin)
# Combinations of these two will also work, so you'll need to pick
# one which works best for you
